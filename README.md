# TickerTab

An intuitive option pricing calculator.

TickerTab is currently in beta. You may try out the web app at [beta.tickertab.io](https://beta.tickertab.io/). Use the default test Stripe card (`4242 4242 4242 4242`) with an expiration in the future and a random three-character CVC. I will shortly be creating some form of community where users can leave feedback, but for now you may [email me](mailto:christopherkapic@gmail.com) for feature requests or bug reports. Alternatively, you may just use the issues on Github.

### A note on the license

TickerTab (the code in this repo) is licensed under the GPL-3.0 License, but the project was bootstrapped with [Vercel's NextJS Subscription Payments Template](https://github.com/vercel/nextjs-subscription-payments). Since TickerTab is licensed under GPL-3.0, you may not create a private fork of _this_ repo. You may, however, bootstrap your own SaaS with Vercel's template and choose to make the source code private if you wish.
